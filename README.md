# Justice and Peace Studies: Active Nonviolence Coursework
## Movement Paper
This was a 6 page paper talking about the movement that I chose which was the People Power Revolution and the removal of the Marcos Regime. This paper consisted of how Marcos came in to power, why this was an issue, and what tactics did the movement utilize in order to achieve their goals.

## Active Allies
This was a 2 page paper in which we analyzed what sort of parties were involved in the movement. The parties we looked at could fall into 5 different categories: Active allies, those that are actively protesting against the opposition and standing with the movement; Passive allies, those that did not participate in the active demonstrations/activities of the movement but shared the same sentiment; Neutral parties, those that could be swayed either way; And passive/active opponents were like their allied counterparts except stood with the opposition.

## Barriers to Participation
This was a 4 page essay building off of Erica Chenoweth and Maria Stephan's idea of what prevents people from joining a movement. These barriers fell into 4 categories; physical, informational, moral, and commitment. A physical barrier is when someone is physically not capable of doing the activities that the movement is participating in. An informational barrier is when the message of a movement is not being received. A moral barrier is when a movement does something that goes against the morals of a person. Finally, a commitment barrier is a barrier in which someone is unable to participate because the consequences are too high. 

## Message Box
An activity in which we analyzed the messages and propoganda of the movement as well as its opposition. We looked at what the movement was saying about itself, its adversary, and was saying to the public. We then looked at what the adversary was saying about itself, its adversary, and was saying to the public. This was to get a better idea of the values of the movement/opposition and how they were trying to convince people to join their side. At the end, we wrote about something that could be improved on in order to increase the spread of the movement's message. 

## Pillars of Support
This was a 6 page paper talking about the pillars of support for the Marcos regime. A pillar of support is a societal group or institution that upholds an oppositional group. This paper addressed what support Marcos had in order to stay in power and what tactics the movement utilized in order to dismantle these pillars or how they didn't.

## SWOT Analysis
A strength, weakness, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis for the movement. Strengths and weaknesses were things that postives and negatives about the movement. Opportunities and threats were things external to the movement that could either help or harm the movement and its goals. At the end, a conclusion from the perspective of someone from the movement which talks about a strength, weakness, opportunity, or threat and how to address it.

## Presentation
This was a culmination of all the aforementioned papers and research into a presentation that would be presented to the class. The presentation had to last around 8 minutes so it was a concise retelling of all the previous works. The presentation consisted of a background of the movement (who, what, where, when, and why), the key adversaries, two concepts from the class and a letter to your great granddaughter from the perspective of someone in the movement. The letter to your great granddaughter had to include some lessons and takeaways that can be learned from the movement.
